# AI Coding Rules for This Project (Pelican-based Static Site)

## 1. Directory Structure

- **Never modify or deploy `docs/`**. This is reserved for Software Design Documentation (SDD), not for the public
  static site content or output.
- **`output/` is for Pelican build artifacts**; ensure all static site deployments reference this directory. Do not
  commit `output/` to version control.
- **`content/` holds all website source material** (Markdown, reStructuredText posts & pages).
- **`quick_pose/` is a Python module with utility code** used to assist in content or asset generation for the site and
  workflows.
- **`plugins/` and `templates/` are reserved for Pelican plugins and template overrides.**

## 2. Automation & Deployment

- **All assets and site generation are automated by scheduled GitHub Actions workflows.**
- **Keep workflow outputs and deployments restricted to the Pelican build output (default: `output/`).**

## 3. Dependency Management

- **Use Poetry with `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.toml`.** All Python dependencies (including Pelican and plugins) go
  here.
- **Do not modify Poetry configurations unless requested.**

## 4. Content Generation and Utilities

- **Leverage `quick_pose/` for reusable Python utilities to generate dynamic content or assets before or during Pelican
  site build.**

## 5. General Code Organization

- **Do not move, rename, or reorganize top-level directories unless specifically instructed.**
- **Do not mix project SDD (docs/) content with website (content/).**

## 6. GitHub Pages

- **Deploy only the static content from Pelican's `output/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.**
